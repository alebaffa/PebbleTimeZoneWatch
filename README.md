PebbleTimeZoneWatch
===================

My first Pebble app. 
The idea is to have a watchface which is able to show the hour of two different timezones of your choice.

## Don't worry
The master branch contains always a working and tested app.

## Update - 14MAY15
- The master now contains the first working version of the watchface.
- For this first version the cities and the timezones are hardcoded.
- This first version is the first hack, so the code is not optimized at all.
